# Harness evolution — D-cycles and strip revision

The procedure for evolving the **canon** — this plugin's repository
(`nikitaCodeSave/claude-code-harness`) — by empirical signals, not by taste.
(An operator's own behavioral baseline lives in their `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and evolves
separately — the kit does not ship or re-distill a copy of it.)
Two operations: the **D-cycle** (folding proven findings inward) and the **strip revision**
(carrying obsolete pieces outward). Both are subordinate to the headline principle: a component
lives only as long as it encodes something the model does not do natively.

## Refresh ledger — the baseline for the delta

The canon ages along three **external** axes: **CC version** (new primitives), **model generation**
(what the model does natively, effort defaults), and **approaches** (first-party essays, arXiv,
community). So the strip revision compares a *delta* rather than "everything from scratch", the
canon carries one provenance stamp — its last grounding point:

<!-- harness-refresh-ledger
last-grounded: CC v2.1.251 · Claude 5 family (Opus 5 default on Max/Team-Premium/Enterprise-PAYG and, since 2.1.251, seat-based Enterprise; Sonnet 5, Fable 5) · 2026-08-29
sources-checked: changelog delta 2.1.227→2.1.251 (local cache, functional Added/Changed/Removed sweep) · code.claude.com/docs/en/whats-new weeks 32-34 · code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams (full re-read — TeamCreate/TeamDelete removed in 2.1.178, named-subagent-becomes-teammate, teammateMode, model precedence) · code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks (31 documented vs 33 in binary) · live binary strings-probe on 2.1.251 (PreModelSwitch/PostModelSwitch, CLAUDE_CODE_RESTRICTED, CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL, promptCacheTtl/subagentPromptCacheTtl, modelPicker, ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_MODEL, teammateMode) · industry (OpenAI open-sourced the Codex harness under Apache-2.0 on 2026-08-20; arXiv 2608.23552 Prime Agent, 2608.17528 Agent Lightning v1.0) · prior grounding at CC v2.1.226 / 2026-08-08
refute-pass 2026-08-29 (v1.23.1–1.23.5, five same-vendor auditors + one cross-vendor): docs pages model-config · sub-agents · tools-reference · code-review · permission-modes · settings-reference · skills · agent-view · claude-directory; live probes: permission-rule warnings on a seeded settings file (`Grep(path)` silent, `MultiEdit` double-warns), `claude agents --json` field names, subagent-transcript forensics on five delegates. **Two of that pass's conclusions were then reverted by the cross-vendor reviewer against the local changelog cache**: `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` is a default (not an override) per the 2.1.251 note, and background `&` *is* classifier-routed per 2.1.218 — the docs pages had gone stale relative to the changelog, and `claude auto-mode defaults` does not enumerate circuit breakers. Lesson recorded in the D-cycle: when a docs page and the changelog of the running version disagree, the changelog wins
-->

The stamp is updated at the end of each strip revision (the external-intake pass below). The
current CC version to compare against is `claude --version`; the built-ins snapshot lives in
`native-capabilities.md`, and its version line after a refresh **must match** this stamp. A delta
of `claude --version` against the ledger is a standalone revision trigger (visible at the start of
a session, with no extra machinery).

## Signal sources

- The project's `.claude/harness-journal.md` — 1–3 "kit-fell-short / kit-got-in-the-way"
  observations per session (opt-in; `operator-playbook.md` §2 says when it is worth keeping).
- The verdicts of external audits (a fresh session told to refute, `/code-review ultra`).
- The operator's corrections along the way (the recurring ones especially).
- **External drift** (CC version / model / approaches) — compared during the strip revision, the
  external-intake pass; the baseline is the refresh-ledger above.

## D-cycle (≈1 session)

Trigger: a milestone closed, or ≥5 substantive observations accumulated. For projects **without a
journal** (it is opt-in) there is no journal trigger — there, milestone-close and the verdicts of
fresh-context audits are what work; don't wait for "5 observations" that have nowhere to come from.

1. **Collect** the journal observations + audit verdicts + operator corrections for the period.
2. **Classify** each: `kit-gap` (the canon didn't cover a recurring need) ·
   `project-specific` (stays in the project CLAUDE.md/rules) · `single-incident`
   (keep watching) · `noise`.
3. **Gate**: only a `kit-gap` with multi-source evidence or repeated empirics passes into the
   canon. **A single-incident does not become an invariant** — it stays in the journal marked
   "watch".
4. **Fold** — a surgical edit of a specific reference (checklist / discipline /
   native-capabilities), not a new file and not a new layer. The wording is model-agnostic;
   evidence provenance (dates, n) is acceptable and desirable. Empirics: harness gains localize in
   tools/middleware/memory, NOT in prose (AHE ablation, arXiv 2604.25850) — prefer a fold into a
   mechanical carrier (a checklist step, a permission rule, a schema) over a new paragraph of prose.
5. **Record it**: a commit to the plugin repo + a devlog entry there listing
   "finding → where it went → evidence". A significant change to the kit's composition →
   a release via `scripts/release.sh <version>` (bump `version` in `plugin.json` — the single
   source of truth — + tag + push). (Maintainer's step: commit/devlog — in the plugin repo;
   the empirics of experiments — in the lab repo. On a consumer machine this step does not
   exist — there the canon is updated with `/plugin update`.)

D-cycle anti-pattern: "since the session is open anyway, I'll tidy up the neighboring sections
too". Edits only from the cycle's findings; everything else is a separate decision.

## Strip revision (every 3–6 months, on a major model release, or on a CC-version delta)

The cadence trigger is the calendar (3–6 months), a major model release, **or** a delta of
`claude --version` against the refresh ledger. The revision runs in two passes: first
**external-intake** (what changed outside — updates the canon to the new reality), then
**re-test** (what in the canon has become obsolete relative to the changed model/environment).

### Pass 1 — external-intake (what shifted outside)

Compare the delta *from the refresh ledger*, not "everything from scratch". Sources are CLI-native
(WebFetch / WebSearch, no Anthropic API):

1. **CC changelog** since the ledger version → new hooks / tools / flags / commands. Fold each
   relevant one into `native-capabilities.md` (it must not fall behind live `claude --version`).
2. **First-party docs / blog** (code.claude.com/docs, anthropic.com / claude.com) → shifts in
   defaults (effort, model-config), new canonical patterns. **When a docs page and the changelog
   of the version you are running disagree, the changelog wins** — a page describes a steady state
   and is updated by hand; a release note is written when the behaviour changes. Two claims were
   fixed in the wrong direction on 2026-08-29 because a settings page still carried pre-upgrade
   semantics and was treated as the newer source. The changelog cache is local
   (`~/.claude/cache/changelog.md`), so this check costs a grep, not a fetch.
3. **`evidence-base.md` source catalog** → new essays / arXiv per the T1–T7 rubric.
4. Run each finding through the D-cycle gate (`kit-gap` with multi-source · `single-incident` ·
   `noise`). An external signal **is not privileged**: "an article came out / a flag appeared"
   does not become an invariant as a single-incident; the fold is a point-edit of a specific
   reference, not a new layer.

### Pass 2 — re-test (what in the canon is obsolete)

1. List the canon's components with their assumption "the model can't do X"
   (including every "under Opus <version>" in the texts).
2. Re-test each: does the model do X natively now. The quick tool is
   `claude --safe-mode` (start with no CLAUDE.md/skills/hooks/MCP): if it's no worse without the
   component — it's obsolete.
3. Obsolete pieces are **deleted, not archived into the canon** (history stays in git + devlog).
4. Whatever the last D-cycle added and that didn't work is the first candidate for removal.
5. **Check the oracle's scope against the claim's scope before writing either down.** A probe
   answers about the moment and the layer where it was taken; a sentence in a reference asserts
   something about a whole lifetime or a whole configuration. A spawn-time binary probe cannot
   settle a property the runtime creates later — an empty field at T0 is what lazy creation looks
   like — and a `--help` listing cannot settle what a subcommand does. Put the oracle where the
   phenomenon lives (act, then observe the artifact), and if the two scopes cannot be made to
   match, write the narrower claim you actually measured.

At the end of the revision — **update the refresh ledger** (new CC version / model / date /
checked sources), sync the version line of `native-capabilities.md`, and record a devlog entry. A
significant shift in the canon's composition → bump `version` (see D-cycle step 5).

## The procedure's evidence base

Grown on the dogfood track (the maintainer's lab Harnesses-Claude, devlog #78–#82 — artifacts not
shipped with the kit): 2 D-cycles, 12 findings folded into the kit, each with journal or audit
empirics; the first-party grounding is Anthropic's "review your configuration every 3-6 months"
and "find the simplest solution possible" (see `references/evidence-base.md`).
